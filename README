NOTE: This version EscapeRoomFinal doesn't have a build in the field BUILD. It needs to be builded. The first version "EscapeRoom" has a build. 
This latest version has one additional task to complete in the escape room (Living Room) compared to the first version. 
Both versions work perfectly. You can move around, complete the tasks, and ultimately finish the game, all accompanied by music and background lighting.


As the final project for the fundamentals of eXtended Reality course, the escape room definitely helped us to have a deeper understanding with implement games in Unity with a VR headset.
